# Release procedure for shub

The Travis build is configured to release shub to PyPI whenever
a new tag is committed.

The steps to do a release are:

1) Install [bumpversion](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bumpversion)

2) Make sure you're in the tip of master, and then run:

    bumpversion VERSION_PART
    
In place of VERSION_PART, use one of `patch`, `minor` or `major`, meaning the
part of the version number to be updated.

This will create a new commit and tag updating the version number.

3) Push the changes and the new tag to trigger the release:

    git push origin master --tags

4) Once the build finishes, run `pip install shub` in a temporary virtualenv
and make sure it's installing the latest version.

5) Update the release information in:
